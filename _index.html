					See What Your Customers See
				</div>

				<div class="about-text">
					Overseer's blackbox monitoring suite allows your test suite to get the same experience as your customers. As soon as something goes wrong, you'll be the first to know.

					Independent Infrastructure
				</div>

				<div class="about-text">
					Monitoring that is dependent on your infrastructure can be brittle. Overseer runs in multiple availability zones, so even in the worst outages you can diagnose your system.

					Discover Regressions First

					Act like a Customer

				<div class="how-it-works-text">
					Overseer's probes simulate real customer behavior. When Overseer isn't able to complete key business flows, neither are your customers. Error messages go from "High 5XX" to "Users can't Sign Up with Facebook."

					Dependency Free

				<div class="how-it-works-text">
					True blackbox monitoring must exist on a separate infrastructure. Building that in house is expensive and distracting.
